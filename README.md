# The Battle of the Neighborhoods

Introduction: Business Problem
The aim of this project is to find a safe and secure location for opening of
commercial establishments in Vancouver, Canada. Specifically, this report will
be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening any business place like
Barbershop in Vancouver City, Canada.
The first task would be to choose the safest borough by analysing crime
data for opening a grocery store and short listing a neighbourhood, where
grocery stores are not amongst the most common venues, and yet as close to
the city as possible.
We will make use of our data science tools to analyse data and focus on the
safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common
venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood where grocery
store is not amongst the most common venue can be selected.
